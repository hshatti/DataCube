# DataCube, Pivot Table 

Remember <span style="color:#0088ff">TDataCube</span> and <span style="color:#0088ff">TPivot</span> components used for TDataset and OLAP data mining back in Delphi late 90's? they were shipped with Delphi by default but for some odd reason those amazing data science and business intelligance components were removed from Delphi later, now you may find them in Excel, Tableau and other data analysis products...
this is a quick implementation of Cube and Pivot in Pascal, not fancy yet but basic functionality works.
